	**<NEW>** 

	(Unnumbered) As a student, I can report problems with the CC questions

**</NEW>**

<new > As a student looking at My Progress and I click a module, and when I'm in the module, I want to see what module I?m in and be able to click out to that webview of that module </New>

**EPIC RESOURCES**

# COMMON BEHAVIORS

 

* Once a student answers a single core question from the module that the concept coach is inside, this module is added to the student's history **for spaced practice **purposes. 

# MOCKUP FOR STORIES

## CC1.08.016  **<NEW>**   For Doomsday Change request

Fix navigation problems in the student concept coach experience.

MOCKUP: [http://3lwsnp.axshare.com/#p=student_modal_doomsday_changes](http://3lwsnp.axshare.com/#p=student_modal_doomsday_changes) 

1. Move CC title/nav thing to be a "Go to ? link", make blue, it goes to the reading that goes with the concept coach questions that are showing.

2. Change Back to Book to CLOSE, make blue

3. Remove "Exercise" nav -> If in My Progress can click the link there. 

4. Change Review to Summary (Review sounds like going to content).

**MOCKUPS**

* [http://3lwsnp.axshare.com/#p=cc_page_module_-_initial](http://3lwsnp.axshare.com/#p=cc_page_module_-_initial)  

**BEHAVIOR**

* WIP: Choosing concept coach question candidates from the current page: 

    * when you import the concept coach book into Tutor, the exercises are mapped to Pools (which live in a Page) by module ID

    * then when assigning a concept coach, we go module UUID -> Page -> Pool -> exercises

    * LO's are used for other operations, like content updates

* We need a ticket to make this algorithm into a napkin note. 

**DECOMPOSITION NOTES**

1. As Tutor, give authenticated and enrolled students their concept coach work for the specified collection / page

    1. BE:  status: needs coding

        1. Stub API endpoint taking CNX UUID and returning CC Task (4 hrs)

        2. Complete API endpoint taking CNX UUID and returning CC Task (16 hrs)

            1. Look up existing task if already made; if not, use the CC assistant to create one

            2. Include Errors paths:

                1. Not in a CC course with this CNX UUID

    2. FE: Status: needs coding, pending UX feedback when student not in the course

# CC1.08.002    As a student, I answer a question inside concept coach

* [http://3lwsnp.axshare.com/#p=cc_page_module_-_modal](http://3lwsnp.axshare.com/#p=cc_page_module_-_modal)

**BEHAVIOR**

* **<new>** In Concept Coach, there will be no option to skip questions. It is a small number, and not allowing skipping gives us the most flexibility for the algorithms to create and add problems.

* Once a question has been seen, it never changes, even if the student does not work the problem.

* **Spaced Practice Decision:** Once a student answers a single core question from the module that the concept coach is inside, this module is added to the student's history for spaced practice purposes. **</new>**

**DECOMPOSITION NOTES**

1. As a student, I answer a question inside concept coach

    1. BE: 

        1. No work

    2. FE: 

        2. Show accordion of questions (8hrs) status: needs coding

        3. refactor Exercise rendering out of Tutor-js (24hrs)status: needed coding

        4. pull Exercise store out of tutor-js (16hrs) status: needed coding

<new> Status: needs design, decomp, pending overlay discussion

2. Tutor needs to display exercises that have 2 to 7 answer choices without breaking. KEF: The reason is that W&N has delivered questions for Concept Coach with between 2 and 7 answer choices.

# CC1.08.003    As a student, I see immediate feedback for questions answered

needs  Definition | Design | Code | Test | Deployment | Document

**MOCKUPS**

* <mockup link & notes> 

**BEHAVIOR**

* **<NEW>** Decision: BE to send both detailed solution and answer-level feedback. 

* Decision: When we have both choice level and detailed solutions, show the choice level feedback. If we ever have only choice level feedback, then show that, of course.

* Needs Decision: When we have only a detailed solution, UX to decide how to handle this cases using the analysis examples below to help think through this.  Since the detailed solution often just restates the correct answer, we might want to indicate it differently. 

    * Resource: [Sample questions and detailed solutions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yAmHD7Uz48a8CRb5CLROufGF4kjQUkYPlzhuydsTPUI/edit#gid=0) for Econ, Sociology, A&P (delivered to date). 

**</NEW>**

**DECOMPOSITION NOTES**

3. As a student, I see immediate feedback for questions answered

    4. Correct/incorrect. Note that the concept coach exercises may two to seven different choices.

    5. Provide answer feedback per question if available. Note that the concept coach exercises may not have choice-specific feedback. If it does not have that, there will be a detailed solution that could be provided as the feedback. Please see sample questions with detailed solutions and choice-level feedback (linked below)

    6. BE: status: needs coding

        5. Make sure that CC exercises give immediate feedback. (4 hrs)

        6. Spike - see if OX Exercises has an API for returning the detailed solution; if not write a card for adding it; (1 hrs)

        7. Modify content import to import exercise detailed solutions (pending availability of that API) (4 hrs)

        8. Modify exercise response to include detailed solution, if available, when feedback is allowed to be given (4 hrs).  

    7. FE:

        9. Add detailed solution to tutor Exercises (8hrs) status: needs coding

            1. Show both individual feedback and detailed solution when available

            2. Content QA: QA detailed solution for all existing tutor exercises (not just CC)

<new>  Needs:  Decomp, UX mockup review

1. Tutor needs to fall back to detail solution when there is not choice-specific feedback. KEF: Analysis of W&N delivered assessments revealed that not all CC questions have choice-specific feedback. When they do NOT have choice-specific feedback, they DO have detailed-solution so we can use that instead.

2. [Sample questions / detailed solutions / choice-level feedback for Economics, Sociology, and A&P (these have been delivered so far).](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yAmHD7Uz48a8CRb5CLROufGF4kjQUkYPlzhuydsTPUI/edit#gid=0) **Please review column B (comments)** -- this shows what we can expect to see. Because of the way the content was developed -- some questions were developed from scratch; others were picked up from the books and re-tagged/re-used at lower cost -- there are some idiosyncrasies that may drive this decision.

    1. UX - need mockup (est 1hr)

    2. FE - pending mockup (est)

BEHAVIOR
CC Spaced Practice napkin note 
WAS THIS: Page gets added to your event history when you work the first problem at the bottom of the page.
<NEW>CHANGED TO ? ## When does an `event` get added to the student's `event history`?

The current `page`
gets added as an `event`
in the student's `event history`
upon clicking the concept coach button
at the bottom of the `page`.

because We wanted to have the history update when the first problem was worked, but backend sends all problems at once and so 
it would be possible to click all buttons at the beginning of the class and then never receive spaced practice.

DECOMPOSITION NOTES

As Tutor, decide what to do when there are no questions for a certain module needs PO Decision
Decision for PO, Question for UX: There can normally be spaced practice questions, but we have stated that we want to populate spaced practice questions as close as possible to them being worked.  If there are no non-spaced practice questions, the first question will be a spaced practice question and depending on if the UX design says we show their questions immediately, we might be in the position of picking the spaced practice questions earlier than desired.  If there's a "Start this CC? button or similar, that would be a way to delay population of the spaced practice problems until the student is actually ready to work them.
